This is my--hopefully final--attempt to host my own website. Each previous attempt has proved unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. I tried using *Wordpress* but didn't like the feeling that I wasn't truly in control of my site data. Next came *Jekyll*, which involved boilerplate code in languages with which I am unfamiliar. When I ran into problems (which were, admittedly, almost certainly of my own making) I realised that I don't have the time or inclination to learn a new language just for a silly little hobby project. (Also, my Jekyll site is hosted through *Github*, which again feels somewhat like giving up control.) Finally, I discovered *Pelican* after stumbling across [LowTech Magazine's website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/). Being somewhat familiar with Python, it seemed a good fit. The website is hosted on `oki`, my little Raspberry Pi 3B+ server (named after the sentient diving suit AI from the sublime *In Other Waters*), with the help of [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/).
