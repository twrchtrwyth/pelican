After a number of false starts, this is my--hopefully--final attempt to host my own website. Each previous attempt has proved unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. Initially I tried using *Wordpress* but didn't like the feeling that I wasn't truly in control of my site data. Next came *Jekyll*, which involved boilerplate code in languages with which I am unfamiliar. When I ran into problems (which were, admittedly, almost certainly of my own making) I realised that I don't have the time or inclination to learn a new language just for a silly little hobby project. (Also, my Jekyll site is hosted through *Github*, which again feels somewhat like giving up control.) Finally, I discovered *Pelican* after stumbling across [LowTech Magazine's website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/). Being somewhat familiar with Python, it seemed a good fit.

I don't really know what to do with the site... It will probably serve as an *ad hoc* repository of things I learn, most likely largely relating to Linux and programming. I might chuck on some thoughts about computer games that I've enjoyed, too.

The website is hosted on `oki`, my little Raspberry Pi 3B+ server (named after the sentient diving suit AI from the sublime *In Other Waters*), with the help of [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/).

The theme is [Future Imperfect](https://html5up.net/future-imperfect) by HTML5 UP, which I have tweaked, broken, and not properly implemented because I can't write HTML properly yet.

I use GIMP to dither my images (Image>Mode>Indexed, 1-bit Floyd-Steinberg).
