## Cardamom Cake

My eternal thanks to Niloufer Ichaporia King for this recipe.

### Ingredients

* 150g unsalted butter, melted
* 250g sugar
* 4 eggs (large)
* 3 tsp cardamom seeds, bruised in a pestle & mortar
  - Approx. 10g of pods
* 200g plain flour
* Salt (generous pinch)
  - Alternatively, use 25g of salted butter in place of 25g of the unsalted butter. This provides approx. 300-600mg of NaCl
* Sliced almonds for topping (optional but incredible)

#### Other stuff

* 23cm springform tin

### Method

1. Oven 160°C fan
1. Butter tin (with extra) and add 2–3 tbsp sugar (extra). Shake to coat sides
1. Cover bottom with sliced almonds
1. Cream eggs + sugar until thick and pale (highest setting for about 5 mins)
1. Quickly fold in flour and salt
1. Then butter and cardamom
1. Stir thoroughly then tip into tin
1. Bash pan on counter to level
1. Bake for 30 mins (40 mins in our oven, then 5-10 mins at 170°C fan)
1. Once out, leave in tin for 5 mins then invert on cake rack to cool (remove bottom of tin whilst still very warm)
