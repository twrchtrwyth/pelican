Summary: The lingering curse of Ayutthaya.

Ellen and I were taught this game by a very nice Parisian couple who we met at our hostel in Ayutthaya.  Ellen then proceeded to thrash me at it across various South East Asian countries.

# Overview

* 52 card pack
* 2-6 players (more probably works, so long as there's a reasonable stock remaining)
* Each card is worth its rank in points (J=11, Q=12, K=13), except for 10s which are worth 0
* The aim is to be the player with the lowest score in their tableau at the end of the round
* Play continues until at least one player reaches 100 points.  The game then ends, and the player with the lowest overall score is the winner

# Play

* Deal a tableau of four separate cards face down to each player.  Players may arrange their tableau however they see fit, but cannot change the order once the first player has begun their turn
* Place the rest of the pack face down in the centre as the stock
* After the deal, each player may peek at two of their cards, but must return them to the table face down
* After this, players *cannot* look at any of their cards unless otherwise specified below.  Cards added to the tableau are always added face-down
* Play is to the left.  A player has three options available to them on their turn:
    1. Look at the top card of the stock, and replace one of their face down cards with this card (also face down), without revealing the new card to the other players.  The replaced card from the tableau is then placed face up next to the stock
    1. Replace a card in their tableau with the top face-up card from the pile next to the stock
    1. Look at the top card of the stock, then reveal this card to all players by placing it face up onto the table next to the stock (either because they do not wish to add it to their tableau, or because it is a court card; see below)
* If a card turned over from the stock is a court card, that player may take an additional action depending on the card's rank[^court]

| Rank | Player action |
| --- | --- |
| Jack | Swap any card in their tableau with any card in another player's tableau, without looking at either |
| Queen | Peek at any card in an opponent's tableau |
| King | Peek at any card in their tableau |

* Whenever a non-court card is revealed in the centre, any player may immediately play a card of equal rank from their tableau face-up on top of it
    - Only one card may be played per revealed card.  Fastest player takes priority.  Further cards cannot be played onto the additional card
    - If the card played does *not* match the rank of the face-up card, the player must put the card played back in their tableau, and must also draw a new card from the stock and add this to their tableau without looking at it
* Immediately after taking their turn, if a player knows the total value of their tableau is below 10, they may call "Dots".  Each other player then gets one further turn before the round ends
* Once each subsequent player has taken their final turn, the round ends.  The player who called "Dots" reveals their tableau and declares their final score.  Each player then does the same
    - If no player's total is equal to or lower than that of the declarer, then they are successful and score no points.  All other players score a number of points equal to the total value of the cards in their tableau
    - If the total of any other player(s) is equal to or less than that of the declarer, the declarer scores 50 points, and no other player scores anything

[^court]: Note that these actions do not occur if a court card is turned over from a player's tableau
