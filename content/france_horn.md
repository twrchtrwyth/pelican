Darkness.

A heavy, expectant silence hangs in the air. Gradually, you begin to notice soft sounds. Wood taps on wood; a chair creaks; a soft cough echoes around the auditorium. You nervously adjust your bow tie in a vain attempt to distract yourself from the fact that your entire life has led to this moment; your first performance as a soloist. Every hornist's dream.

The stage lights begin to heave into life. A single soft note sounds out from the first violinist's chair, and soon you are bathed in the glorious swell of the orchestra as the last, exquisitely fine adjustments are made. The sound blankets you, and you feel that familiar, strange calmness descend as you raise your instrument to your lips.

You draw breath...
