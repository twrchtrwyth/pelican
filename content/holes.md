Topology stems from Euler's formula for polyhedra:

<p>
<i>
F - E + V = 2
</i>
</p>

where *F* = *number of* ***faces***, *E* = *number of* ***edges***, and *V* = *number of* ***vertices***.  This equation holds true for all polyhedra that do not self-intersect.  A slightly modified version, which includes the number of holes *g* in the polyhedron, is below:

<p>
<i>
F - E + V = 2 - 2g
</i>
</p>

Topology deals with the deformation of shapes.  It tells us that certain shapes or solids--even those we would consider to be distinct, such as triangles, squares and circles--are in fact identical, so long as the shape is not broken during deformation.  This can be visualised by imagining these figures drawn on a sheet of stretchy rubber--as the sheet is stretched or compressed, the shape will morph into any number of others.  According to topological theory, the primary difference between objects is their number of holes.
