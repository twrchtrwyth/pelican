Topology stems from Euler's formula for polyhedra:

$$
F - E + V = 2
$$

where $F$ is *number of* **faces**, $E$ is *number of* **edges**, and $V$ is the *number of* **vertices**. This equation holds true for all polyhedra that do not self-intersect. A slightly modified version, which includes the number of holes $g$ in the polyhedron, is below:

$$
F - E + V = 2 - 2g
$$

Topology deals with the deformation of shapes. It tells us that certain shapes or solids--even those we would consider to be distinct, such as triangles, squares and circles--are in fact identical, so long as the shape is not broken during deformation. This can be visualised by imagining these figures drawn on a sheet of stretchy rubber--as the sheet is stretched or compressed, the shape will morph into any number of others. According to topology the primary difference between objects is their number of holes.
