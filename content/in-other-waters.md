A common touching point for In Other Waters is (the also excellent, but cripplingly terrifying) *Subnautica*. Unlike Subnautica, however, In Other Waters is completely non-violent: you don't even harm discovered organisms, instead carefully selecting samples for analysis from discarded shells, dead specimens, mucus deposits, and so on. About the worst that will happen is that the human protagonist (a biologist named Ellery Vas) will become mildly hypoxic after spending too long in a bathypelagic brine lake, and will need to be whisked back to safety. A video game without conflict is, sadly, a true rarity in the medium, but In Other Waters provides an exemplary demonstration of how rich a narrative can be told without shedding a drop of blood. Dr Vas is a thoughtful and caring protagonist akin to Dr Lian of 2012's *Waking Mars*, with which I think In Other Waters shares a much closer bond than it does with Subnautica.

Another close cousin is 2016's ABZÃ›--except for the bloody terrifying Great White Shark that insists on showing up in the latter.
