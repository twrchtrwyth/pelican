Traditional Japanese music uses a variety of very characteristic pentatonic scales. Below are some examples, as well as a couple of modes. As an interesting side note, traditionally in Japan the root is not the first note of the scale as in "Western" music, but the *third* note in the pentatonic scale: that is, the central note. This supposedly ties in with historical concepts of balance and harmony.
