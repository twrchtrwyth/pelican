Testing maths syntax. Uses the `render-math` plugin for Pelican. The equation for an ideal gas is $Pv = nRT$. Einstein's equation that relates mass to energy is $E = mc^2$.

Below is the binomial theorem:

$$(a + b)^{n} = \sum_{k = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}$$

The notation $\binom{n}{k}$ stands for, "the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set containing $n$ elements in total." This can also be expressed algebraically as:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$$
