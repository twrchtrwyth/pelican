You find yourself at the Library's centre.  At your feet, innumerable hexagons yawn endlessly into the void.  Above you, no ceiling; only the hexagonal column, retreating as far as the eye can see.

You tear your eyes from the dizzying sight.  A book on a nearby shelf attracts your attention.  Along its spine, spidery letters spell *Axaxaxas Mlo*.

Will you leaf through its [pages][]?  Or would you rather peruse [all that the library has to offer][all]?[^broken]

Generations ago, by some dark and blasphemous art, a heretical sect birthed the [Index of Categories][cat] from the Library's incomprehensible catalogue.  Recently, you have caught fearful whispers of a power struggle amongst the heretics, which some have labelled the [Schism of the Tags][tag].

[^broken]: Please note that the Chief Librarian is notorious for getting halfway through things and then just moving on to something else, and sticking the unfinished stuff on the website anyway
