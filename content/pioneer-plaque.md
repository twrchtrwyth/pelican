The Pioneer 10 space probe, launched in 1972, is currently one of five man-made objects that have either left, or are on course to leave, the solar system. Attached to the probe is a small engraved aluminium plaque anodised with gold. At the time the probe was launched, it was thought that it would be the first such object to leave the solar system (it has actually now been overtaken by Voyager I and will soon be overtaken by Voyager II). As such, Eric Burgess and Richard Hoagland approached Carl Sagan to suggest that the craft carry some indication of the area and time from which it originates, as well as a representation of its creators.

## The hyperfine transition of hydrogen

Clearly, trying to formulate a decipherable message whilst knowing nothing about the beings who might read it proved challenging. Whilst acknowledging that any such message will unavoidably be constrained by the logical processes of its creators, it was decided that the most likely thing that another intelligent species would share with humanity is a knowledge of fundamental science: in this case, physics. As such, a representation of the hyperfine transition of hydrogen was included in the top left of the engraving. As well as serving as something of an indicator of human scientific progress ("we know about quantum physics"--whatever the discovering race's term for that is--assuming they use terms at all), it provides the reference for most of the measurements shown on the plaque. Specifically, the image shows the transition from antiparallel to parallel nuclear and electronic spins in a neutral hydrogen atom. These representations are joined by a line labelled with the binary digit 1, represented as **I** in this case.

The two reference measurements are of length and of time. When transitioning between these states, a photon is emitted. The spin-flip transition between these quantum states has an energy difference $E$ of $5.87433 \mathrm{\mu eV}$, which corresponds to the energy of the released photon. Using the non-SI units of $\mathrm{eV \cdot s}$ for the Planck constant $h$, the Planck relation $E = h \nu$ of energy to frequency $\nu$ then allows us to determine the wavelength $\lambda$ of an emitted photon:

$$
\lambda = \frac{c}{\nu} = \frac{h}{E}\times c \approx 0.21106\mathrm{m} \approx 21\mathrm{cm}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum (about $2.9979\times10^{8}\mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-1}$) and the Planck constant $h$ has the value $4.1357\times10^{-15} \mathrm{eV} \cdot \mathrm{s}$.

Using the value of $\lambda$ from above (in metres), the frequency $\nu$ is then given by:

$$
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} \approx 1420\mathrm{MHz} = 1.42\times10^{9}\mathrm{s}^{-1}
$$

The period of this wave is thus equal to:

$$
\frac{1}{1.42\times10^{9}} \approx 0.7\mathrm{ns}
$$

This provides us with both the reference measurements used elsewhere on the plaque: length (21 centimetres) and time (0.7 nanoseconds). It is assumed that any species discovering the plaque will have developed some analogous means of expressing fundamental units such as distance and time, though this may just demonstrate the limitations of human conception.

## Binary numbers

Binary numbers are expressed using just 0 and 1 (or conceivably any two different symbols). They are written in base two, whereas conventional decimal numbers are written in base ten.

| Binary     | Decimal     |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
|  1         |  1          |
|  10        |  2          |
|  100       |  4          |
|  101       |  5          |
|  111       |  7          |
|  10010110  |  150        |

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the binary number 10010110. From right to left, each digit in the number represents increasing powers of 2 (as opposed to increasing powers of 10 as seen in decimal notation):

| $2^{7}$ | $2^{6}$ | $2^{5}$ | $2^{4}$ | $2^{3}$ | $2^{2}$ | $2^{1}$ | $2^{0}$ |
|:---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

When converting from binary to decimal, a 1 in a position indicates that the power of 2 represented by that position should be added to the total. A 0 indicates that the corresponding power of 2 should be ignored. So, in the case of 10010110:

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|:---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1   | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

and thus 10010110 in binary is equal to 128 + 16 + 4 + 2 = 150 in decimal.

Evidently, any extraterrestrial species that finds the plaque will not be familiar with Indo-Arabic numerals (unless that intelligence is humanity in the far future). As such, instead of 0s and 1s the Pioneer plaque uses **--** and **I**, respectively, to represent binary numbers. For example, the binary number 10010110 would instead be written as **I -- -- I -- I I --**. Regardless, this is probably the single most problematic assumption made on the plaque: another intelligence might not conceive of mathematics in remotely the same manner as humanity does at present (for example, consider the beings in Ted Chiang's *Story of Your Life*), so the concept of expressing numbers--which are ultimately a human invention--as increasing powers of another number might not even occur to them. Nonetheless, the symbolic binary is an elegant attempt to get around this problem.

## The Human Figures

To the right of the plaque are two distinctive human figures, in front of the Pioneer craft to scale. To the right of the female figure are two parallel horizontal lines, between which is written the binary digit **I -- -- --** which corresponds to 8 in decimal. This is intended as a representation of the female figure's height: recall the length definition of the binary number **I** as 21cm. Thus the female figure's height is 8 x 21cm = 168cm or about 5 foot 6 inches. This also serves, somewhat cyclically, as another clue as to what the binary **I** between the hydrogen states is intended to signify.
