# Overview

- Two players
- 32 cards (remove 2–6)
- Deal 12 each (in batches of two or three), remaining 8 as talon
- Each player discards and replaces cards once, in turn, starting with non-dealer
- Non-dealer may declare categories of combinations[^declaring] in hand to [score](#scoring)
    * Opponent may then declare, where appropriate
- Play for tricks (must follow suit, no trumps, winner of trick leads to next)
- Six deals in total[^partie], alternating dealer
- Highest score wins, then there’s a bit of numberwang


# Play

- Non-dealer can discard up to five (min. 1) then replace from talon
    * Can choose to privately look at any remaining cards that could have taken (i.e. up to four)
- Opponent can then discard up to the number of cards remaining in talon then replace from talon, but does not have to discard any
    * Can choose to reveal any remaining cards to both players after non-dealer has led
- If players discard less than full permitted amount, must announce this in advance
- Non-dealer declares combinations in each category in turn--in each case, if opponent does not have better or equal, non-dealer scores
- After declarations, non-dealer leads a card
- Dealer may now announce and score for any combinations in "not good" categories, or where non-dealer made no declaration


# Scoring

## Carte Blanche

A player whose hand does not contain any face cards may immediately declare *carte blanche*, which is worth 10 points.  This is proved by dealing all cards face up onto the table immediately before discarding.[^blank]

## Declaration

During the declaration, non-dealer may announce their best combination in each category in turn.  Their opponent responds as follows:

| Response | Meaning | Outcome |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Good     | Opponent does not have better or equal in stated category | Non-dealer scores for category in question |
| Not good | Opponent holds better combination in stated category | Opponent scores for category in question |
| Equal    | Opponent holds equal combination in stated category | Further information to be provided by non-dealer (see below table) |

Scores for declared combinations are as follows:

| Category | Description | Details | Point Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Point | Most cards in one suit | If equal, sum value of all cards in suit: highest total wins (A = 11, face = 10, others as ranked) | = number of cards in suit |
| Sequence | Longest run in single suit | Min. 3, highest card best if equal | = length of sequence, +10 if 5 or more |
| Set | Three (trio) or four (quatorze) of a kind of rank 10 or higher | Quatorze always beats trio, highest card best if equal | Trio = 3, quatorze = 14 |

If each player holds a combination that is exactly equal, neither player scores for that category.

If they score for them, players can score for multiple sequences or trios/quatorzes present in hand.  Players might not hold a combination in all categories, in which case their opponent may score if they hold a combination in the category in question.

There is no obligation to declare combinations.

## Tricks

Non-dealer scores 1 for leading to the first trick.  Players score 1 for winning a trick if they led, and 2 for winning a trick if they did not.[^tricks]  The winner of the final trick also scores an additional 1 point.

Winning the majority of tricks (7-11) scores a bonus 10 points, and winning all 12 scores 40.[^capot]  (These points do not count towards *pique*.)

## Repique and Pique

For the purposes of *repique* and *pique*, points are scored in the following order:

*Carte Blanche*, Point, Sequence, Set, Tricks

Repique
: A player who scores 30 from *declarations only*[^repique] before their opponent has scored anything, and before any card is played to a trick, gains 60 additional points.

Pique
: As for *repique*, but also includes points from tricks, and is instead worth 30 points.  Because non-dealer always scores 1 for leading, only they can score for *pique*.


# End

Here comes numberwang.

The game ends after all six hands are played.  At this point, if both players have over 100 points, the one with the larger total scores 100 plus the *difference between* the two scores.  Otherwise, if the player with the lower score has less than 100 points, the player with the larger total scores 100 plus the *total* of the two scores.

If scores are equal after the six deals, then another two are played.  If still equal, the game is a tie.

[Rules on David Parlett's site](https://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/piqrules.html)


[^declaring]: A player might not hold combinations in all categories.
[^partie]: The six deals are referred to as a *partie*.
[^blank]: If non-dealer has *carte blanche*, before revealing their cards they must announce how many cards they intend to discard.  Their opponent must then set aside their cards to be discarded before non-dealer's cards are revealed.
[^tricks]: There appears to be some variation between sources in terms of how exactly to score for tricks.  Some sources say 1 point is scored every time a player *leads* to a trick, but others state that the point is only scored if the player *wins* the trick to which they led.  Similarly, there seems to be variation as to whether a player scores 1 or 2 points for winning a trick to which their opponent led.
[^capot]: Winning all twelve available tricks is referred to as *capot*.
[^repique]: As far as I can tell, *carte blanche* counts towards the 30 points, but it's not entirely clear.  *Carte blanche* is scored first, and so can certainly prevent an opponent from scoring for *repique*.
