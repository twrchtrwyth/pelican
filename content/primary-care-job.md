## Primary Care Overview

Aim to "support primary care services to build resilience and deliver high quality care" by:

* Supporting general practice to implement safe and effective processes for Care Navigation
* Supporting General Practice with prescribing
* Enabling improvements in Anticipatory Care Planning
* Supporting implementation and progress of GP Cluster Working in Scotland
* Developing the Primary Care Learning System

### Care Navigation

* Better use of GP appointments and resources
* Ensure patients seen but right person at right time in right place
* Improve responsibility sharing within practice teams and wider primary care system
* Promote effective MDT working

### Pharmacotherapy

* 11% of unplanned hospital admissions due to harm from medicines
* 70% of these in elderly patients on multiple medicines
* "Cumulative toxicity", anticholinergic burden, etc.
* Deprescribing (but not necessarily always the aim of reviews)

Two year EU-funded <abbr title="Stimulating Innovation Management of Polypharmacy and Adherence in the Elderly">SIMPATHY</abbr> (that is an appalling acronym) study investigated polypharmacy in Europe, made six key recommendations:

1. MDT and leadership key
1. Culture that prioritises safe prescribing
1. Patients encouraged to be involved in decisions
1. Use data to drive change and measure outcomes
1. Adopt evidence-based approach
1. Utilise, develop and share tools to support implementation

Are you fucking serious, did that really take two years and god only knows how many Euro to figure out.

Aim to:

* Improve management of repeat/long-term Rx, e.g.
	- Utilising serial prescriptions[^serial prescriptions]--there is a serial prescriptions toolkit to support this
	- Converting "Acute" prescriptions to regular where appropriate
* Effectively triage medicine-related jobs to the right person
* Reduce GP staff workload (including pharmacists)
* Allow GPs to do GP stuff instead of being bogged down with meds
* Monitor high-risk medicines
* Medicines reconciliation when passing between sectors
* Clinics

Acute Prescribing Toolkit launched this month.

### Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP)

Person-centred, proactive approach to help people consider what's important to them and to plan for their future care.

* Support discussions with patients, carers, families, etc.
* Coordination across care settings
* Reduce inappropriate interventions, hospital admissions and "repeated difficult conversations"
* Particularly beneficial for
	- Long-term health conditions
	- Diabilities/complex health and care needs
	- Deteriorating health/wellbeing due to physical or mental health problems
	- End of life
	- Children/young people with life-limiting conditions

### GP Cluster Working

A professional grouping of general practices, represented at periodic meetings by Practice Quality Leads. GP Clusters introduced in Scotland in 2016-7, then part of GMS 2018 agreement. Each practice has a Practice Quality Lead, each cluster has a Cluster Quality Lead.

Benefits/disadvantages

* Great potential to improve quality of care
* Implementation  not fully supported or prioritised
* Variation across the country
* Generally GPs have come together to share and discuss quality issues
* QI, data, leadership and engagement are key
* Barriers include time limitations, lack of support, lack of available meaningful data, lack of clarity of purpose, roles and responsibilities of clusters, HSCPs, NHS boards

### Primary Care Learning System

* Sharing learning and improvement work
* Sharing good practice
* Collaborative working
* Sharing evidence

## GMS Contract

My notes

## Questions to ask

1. Is IP funded?
1. What exactly does IP study time involve?

[^serial prescriptions]: Serial prescriptions are those used as part of the <abbr title="Medicines Care and Review">MCR</abbr> service. They are valid for up to 12 months, with a set dispensing interval.
