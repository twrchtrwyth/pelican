# THE SHAVIAN ALPHABET

The Shavian alphabet is used to represent *sounds* in English, rather than individual letters (though many letters map directly to the equivalent letter in English).  "Normal" spoken English contains 40 unique sounds, each of which is represented by a unique Shavian letter.  In addition, Shavian contains 8 compound letters which are used to represent common combinations of sounds.

## Additional Notes

* A letter can be either **tall** (*higher* on the line) or **deep** (*lower* on the line).  Tall letters are unvoiced---there is no vibration of the vocal chords.  Deep letters on the other hand are voiced---the vocal chords vibrate. For example, compare the sounds of 𐑕 (tall) and 𐑟 (deep).
* The letter 𐑧 looks like part of the letter 'e' which can help to remember its sound.
* Note that the letter 𐑱 for **AI**m is almost the same as the letter 𐑧 for **E**dge, except with an added line---this represents the added 'ee' sound after the 𐑧 sound, which lengthens the sound.  This concept will recur in the case of other letters.
* The letter 𐑲 for **EYE**s (cf. 𐑨 for **A**sh) follows the same system as 𐑧 and 𐑱 above, where the extra line adds the 'ee' sound after the 𐑨 sound.
* Note the similarity between the letters 𐑥 and 𐑯.  To remember which is which, the following may be helpful.  The sound 𐑥 is made with the lips at the *front* of the mouth, whereas 𐑯 is made with the tongue pointing *back*.
* 𐑑 and 𐑛 are also similar.  Think of 𐑑 as pointing to the **T**op, and 𐑛 as pointing **D**own.
* 𐑤 and 𐑮 can be remembered using your **L**eft (𐑤𐑧𐑓𐑑) and **R**ight (𐑮𐑲𐑑) hands and forming them each into a cup shape: when viewed the corresponding hand will form the corresponding shape.
* The compound letter 𐑼 allows pronunciation however the speaker sees fit---that is, it allows for *different accents*.  For example, many British accents wouldn't pronounce the final "r" sound in "flavour", but an American might.
