This is a post about *Vampyroteuthis infernalis*, the Vampire Squid from Hell. It serves little purpose other than testing my summary truncation limit, and seeing what the squid look like in dithered images.

It is the only extant member of the order Vampyromorphida, and is most closely related to octopuses. Despite their (amazing) name, vampire squid do not feed on blood: rather, they use one of their two elongated filaments to catch marine snow as it passes by on its way to the seabed. They then retract this filament and use their tentacles to wipe the captured snow into their mouthparts. So, essentially, they survive on shit and corpses.
