<p>Darkness.</p>
<p>A heavy, expectant silence hangs in the air. Gradually, you begin to notice soft sounds. Wood taps on wood; a chair creaks; a soft cough echoes around the auditorium. You nervously adjust your bow tie, trying to ignore the fact that your entire life has led to this moment. All the lessons during and after school. The countless band rehearsals and concerts. Your audition for the Royal College. Your graduation. Successes and failures, joy and&nbsp;disappointment.</p>
<p>You still remember the day you received your acceptance letter to the orchestra. Suddenly, there was hope for the future. It has all led to this: your first performance as a soloist. Every hornist&#8217;s&nbsp;dream.</p>
<p>The stage lights begin to heave into life. A single soft &#8216;A&#8217; sounds out from the direction of the first violinist&#8217;s chair, and soon you are bathed in the glorious swell of the orchestra as the last, exquisitely fine adjustments are made. The sound blankets you, and you feel that familiar, strange calmness descend as you raise your instrument to your&nbsp;lips.</p>
<p>You draw&nbsp;breath&#8230;</p>                </article>
